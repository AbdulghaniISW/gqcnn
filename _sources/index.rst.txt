Berkeley AUTOLAB's GQCNN Package
================================
The `gqcnn` package facilitates training Grasp Quality Neural Networks (GQ-CNNs) on datasets from the `Dexterity Network`_ (Dex-Net) and using GQ-CNNs to plan parallel-jaw grasps from point clouds on a physical robot.
Installation has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, and 16.04.

Please raise all bugs, feature requests, and other issues under the `Github Issues`_.
For other questions or concerns, please contact Jeff Mahler (jmahler@berkeley.edu).
